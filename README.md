## Description

This social network api was created to serve as the back end for a social media app. Its MongoDB database, Mongoose ODM, and Express routing allows users to create accounts, add friends, post thoughts, and give reactions to thoughts in a well organized and developed CRUD api. This project helped me become more efficent and improve my skills using MongoDB, Mongoose ODM, and Express routing. Having subdocument schemas was challenging but improved the organization and flow of the models.
